# Stochastic-Gradient-Descent

This notebook is based on [Machine Learning:Classification](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification/home/welcome) Course by UW on Coursera.
The goal of this notebook is to implement a logistic regression classifier using stochastic gradient ascent:

 * Extract features from Amazon product reviews.
 * Convert an SFrame into a NumPy array.
 * Write a function to compute the derivative of log likelihood function with respect to a single coefficient.
 * Implement stochastic gradient ascent.
 * Compare convergence of stochastic gradient ascent with that of batch gradient ascent.
